Exchange-a-Rate

This program prompts you for your native currency and allows you to compare it to either all countries across the world or with a particular country in mind in which the user is given specific details regarding that countries currency. It contais default information for currendcy data (courtesy of RubyMoney) and is able to give current rates through the API requestes. Based on the users selections, it can understand and link updated to exchange rates to the specific currency they're refeering to.

This initially appeared on

I can no longer open that page as there are too many comments, I have
moved it here.
